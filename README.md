# BetterPhysics

This is a mod for Sonic Adventure's 2004 PC port that tweaks and alters SADX's physics to hopefully be more enjoyable, and have a higher skill ceiling. Specifically, the slope physics have been changed so that rolling has far greater of an effect on your speed, and the mid-air controls have been altered slightly to allow for greater conservation of momentum. There are also many experimental features added that are disabled by default, such as removing loop automation, so that the player can gain speed going through them by using physics. Also, most aspects of the mod are configurable.
